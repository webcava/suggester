## 🧠 How It Works

1. You configure a tool with a prompt template tailored to your content needs  
2. Embed it anywhere on your site using a shortcode (e.g., `[suggester id='1']`)  
3. Visitors enter keywords into the tool  
4. The plugin sends that input to the AI service you selected  
5. Suggestions are returned and instantly displayed on the page

## 🔐 Privacy & Data Use

Suggester does not store or collect any personal data from users. When someone uses a suggestion tool, only the keyword they enter and your configured prompt are sent to the external AI service (Google Gemini or OpenRouter, depending on your setup).
